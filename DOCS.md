## Getting Started

The AK2 Dashboard is a web interface accessible through your browser when your printer is connected to your network. Simply navigate to your printer's IP address with the configured port (default: 8000).

Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8000`

### First Time Setup

1. **Network Connection** - Ensure your printer is connected to your local network
2. **Find IP Address** - Check your router or printer display for the IP
3. **Access Dashboard** - Open the URL in your web browser
4. **Configure Kobra Unleashed** (Optional) - Edit `/mnt/UDISK/webfs/api/webserver.json` to set your MQTT server URL

---

## Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your printer's status and controls.

### Printer Statistics
- **Temperature** - Current and target temperatures for hotend and bed
- **Print Progress** - Real-time progress percentage and time estimates
- **Status** - Current printer state (idle, printing, paused, etc.)
- **Position** - Current X, Y, Z coordinates

### Printer Controls
- **Upload & Print** - Upload G-code files directly from your computer
- **Pause/Resume** - Control ongoing prints
- **Stop** - Cancel current print job
- **File Selection** - Browse and select files from printer storage

### Print History
View your printing history with timestamps and filenames.

### Webcam Stream
Live view from your USB camera (if connected).

## Bed Mesh Leveling

The most powerful feature of the AK2 Dashboard is the advanced bed mesh leveling system.

### The Problem

Stock firmware's bed leveling produces inconsistent results. The same probe point can measure differently each time:
- First measurement: -0.09mm
- Second measurement: -0.06mm
- Third measurement: -0.11mm

This inconsistency leads to poor first-layer adhesion and print failures.

### The Solution: Mesh Averaging

The averaging system combines multiple leveling passes to produce a reliable, consistent mesh.

### How It Works

1. **Run Auto-Level** - Perform bed leveling from your printer as usual
2. **Save Slot** - The dashboard detects new mesh data and prompts you to save it as a "slot"
3. **Repeat** - Run leveling several more times (5-6 recommended), saving each as a new slot
4. **Calculate Average** - The system automatically computes the average of all slots
5. **Apply** - Click "Set mesh average data" to write the averaged mesh to your printer.cfg
6. **Reboot** - Restart the printer for changes to take effect

### The Math

The algorithm is simple yet effective:
```
For each probe point:
  Average = (Slot1 + Slot2 + Slot3 + ... + SlotN) / N
```

Each corresponding point from all saved slots is summed and divided by the number of slots, resulting in a statistically superior mesh that eliminates measurement noise.

### Advanced Settings

**Custom Grid Size**
- K2 Pro: Default 5×5, max 6×6
- K2 Plus/Max: Default 7×7, max 10×10
- Increase grid density for more detailed mesh data
- ⚠️ Increase by one point at a time to avoid firmware limitations

**Leveling Temperature**
- Set custom bed temperature for leveling
- Recommended to match your most common print temperature
- Accounts for thermal expansion at printing temps

**Precision**
- Set decimal precision for averaged results
- 0.01mm precision: Values <0.005 round to 0.00, ≥0.005 round to 0.01
- Experiment to find optimal settings for your printer

### Slot Management

- **Save Slots** - Up to 99 slots can be saved
- **View Specific Slot** - Enter slot number and click visualize
- **Delete Slots** - Clear specific slots or all slots
- **Automatic Numbering** - Slots are numbered automatically

### Visualization

- **Current Mesh** - View the mesh currently in printer.cfg
- **Average Mesh** - View the calculated average mesh
- **Specific Slot** - View any saved slot in 3D
- **Compare** - Compare current vs. average to see improvements

---

## Profiles System

Profiles allow you to save complete leveling configurations for different scenarios.

### Use Cases

**Different Build Plates**
- Plate 1: Standard PEI sheet
- Plate 2: Textured spring steel
- Plate 3: Glass plate

Each plate has different thickness and magnetic properties, requiring unique mesh data.

**Different Materials**
- PLA Profile: 60°C bed temperature
- PETG Profile: 80°C bed temperature
- ABS Profile: 100°C bed temperature

Thermal expansion varies with temperature, so mesh data taken at one temperature won't be optimal at another.

### How to Use

1. **Create Configuration** - Set up your leveling (grid size, temperature, etc.)
2. **Generate Averaged Mesh** - Use the slot system to create a reliable mesh
3. **Save Profile** - Store the complete configuration
4. **Switch Profiles** - Load different profiles as needed
5. **Apply** - Set active profile and reboot printer

**Note:** Profile naming is not yet supported. Keep notes of which profile number corresponds to which configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Won't Load

**Check Network Connection**
- Verify printer is connected to network
- Ping the printer IP from your computer
- Check firewall settings

**Check Port**
- Default port is 8000
- Verify port in custom firmware config
- Try `http://PRINTER_IP:8000`

**Restart Webserver**
- SSH into printer
- `killall webfsd`
- `/opt/bin/webfsd` (restart manually)

### Webcam Not Working

**Verify Camera**
- USB camera connected?
- Check `lsusb` output via SSH
- Test camera: `v4l2-ctl --list-devices`

**Format Support**
- Camera must support MPEG or YUYV
- Resolution 640×480 required
- Try different USB port

### Mesh Leveling Issues

**Inconsistent Results**
- This is normal for stock firmware
- Use the averaging system (5-6 slots minimum)
- Check probe cleanliness

**Grid Size Errors**
- Increase grid by one point at a time
- K2 Pro max: 6×6
- K2 Plus/Max max: 10×10
- Larger grids may cause firmware errors

**Average Not Applied**
- Did you click "Set mesh average data"?
- Did you reboot the printer after?
- Check that "Current Mesh" matches "Average Mesh" after reboot

### File Browser Issues

**Files Not Showing**
- Verify file permissions via SSH
- Check directory exists
- Refresh page

**Preview Not Working**
