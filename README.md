# AK2 Dashboard

**Modern web interface for Anycubic Kobra 2 Series 3D printers**

A community-maintained fork bringing a complete UI overhaul, advanced bed leveling, and full printer control to your browser.

## About This Project

This is an actively maintained fork of [AGG2017's ACK2-Webserver](https://github.com/AGG2017/ACK2-Webserver), featuring a complete transformation from static HTML to a modern Svelte application. Born from the Kobra 2 hacking community's efforts to overcome Anycubic's closed-source limitations, this project is part of a larger ecosystem of tools that enable full control over your printer.

**Why this exists:** Anycubic released the Kobra 2 series with locked-down, closed-source firmware. The community reverse-engineered access, and this dashboard is one of the results - now maintained and actively developed after the original projects were abandoned.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎯 **Comprehensive Dashboard** - Real-time stats, webcam stream, and full printer control
- 🔧 **Advanced Bed Mesh Leveling** - Intelligent averaging algorithm for consistent first layers

```

**New User?** See **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)** for complete jailbreak and installation instructions.

**Access Dashboard:** `http://YOUR_PRINTER_IP:8000`

### For Developers

**Build the entire package:**
```bash
make
```

**Development mode (frontend only):**
```bash
cd frontend

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- [WEBFS](https://linux.bytesex.org/misc/webfs.html) - Lightweight static web server
- [MUSL](https://musl.libc.org) - Minimal C library for ARM cross-compilation
- Custom C API for printer integration

**Frontend:**
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) - Modern web application framework
- [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/) - 3D mesh visualization
- [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) - Syntax highlighting

## 🌟 Highlights

### Unified Printer Control
No more juggling multiple interfaces! Integrated printer controls (upload, print, pause/resume, stop) directly in the dashboard via Kobra Unleashed API integration. One interface for everything - bed leveling, system tools, and printer control.

### Advanced Bed Leveling
The stock firmware's inconsistent probing is solved with an intelligent averaging algorithm. Run leveling multiple times, save each result, and the system computes a statistically superior mesh for perfect first layers.

### Real-Time System Monitoring
View CPU usage, memory, temperatures, and service status. Access printer logs with error highlighting, deduplication, and follow mode.

### File Management
Browse the printer filesystem with syntax-highlighted previews for code and configs, plus hex dump view for binary files.

## 📜 License

Open source project. Check individual files for specific licenses. Built on WEBFS (public domain) and incorporates various open-source libraries.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

**Jailbreak Required:** This dashboard requires a jailbroken Kobra 2 printer with root access via UART. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for complete instructions.

**No Firmware Distributed:** This project does NOT host or distribute Anycubic firmware files. The [kobra2-fw-tools](https://github.com/cardil/kobra2-fw-tools) downloads official firmware from Anycubic's public servers and provides tools to modify it.

**Community Project:** Not affiliated with or endorsed by Anycubic. Installing custom firmware may void your warranty. The original firmware contains parts of Klipper (evidenced by printer.cfg format), which raises questions about GPL compliance.

**Use at Your Own Risk:** Always backup important files (`/user` directory) before modifications. Keep working firmware files accessible. This is experimental software developed by the community.

**Maintained Fork:** The original projects (ACK2-Webserver, Kobra Unleashed, firmware tools) were abandoned. These forks are actively maintained to keep the Kobra 2 hacking community alive.
