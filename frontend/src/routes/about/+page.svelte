    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      The closed-source nature of these 3D printers imposes limitations on end users, confining
      them to the functionalities predetermined by software designers and dictated by the
      manufacturer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lack of flexibility stifles innovation and prevents users from implementing their own
      ideas for product enhancements. Recognizing these limitations, we set out to address these
      gaps with this Custom Webserver solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Custom Webserver offers additional features unavailable in the stock firmware. Among
      these enhancements you'll find advanced bed mesh leveling tools, 3D bed mesh visualization
      capabilities, mesh leveling profiles, custom level temperature, custom grid empowering users
      with greater control over their printing processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, we've integrated essential printer information, including alternative cloud
      solutions that enable remote printing, file upload, printer status monitoring, and more,
      alongside CPU usage, free memory, SSH status, printer log access, and additional features,
      directly into the interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designed for optimal performance, the Webserver operates with remarkable efficiency,
      utilizing system resources such as memory with less than 1% utilization. CPU load remains
      minimal, only spiking during web page requests, ensuring a seamless user experience. This
      project has demanded a significant investment of time and effort, and any help in
      contributing to the project will be greatly appreciated.
